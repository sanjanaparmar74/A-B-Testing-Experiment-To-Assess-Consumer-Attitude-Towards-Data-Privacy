## Survey Metadata

+ We have collected so far `r nrow(df)` surveys.
+ These include `r nrow(df_finished)` finished surveys.
+ We have `r nrow(control_group)` subjects in the control group and `r nrow(treatment_group)` subjects in the treatment groups

## Where Survey Participants Are Coming From 

```{r}
map_df <- df%>%select(LocationLatitude,LocationLongitude)
mapWorld <- borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="white")
mp <- ggplot() + mapWorld
mp + geom_point(data = map_df, aes(x =as.numeric(LocationLongitude), y=as.numeric(LocationLatitude)))
  
```

## Data Exploroation 
We collected `r nrow(df)` responses from our survey, and this included `r nrow(df_finished)` completed surveys. As you can see from the figure (map) the majority of respondents are from the United States. We also received several responses from individuals living in India.

Our treatment group consisted of `r nrow(treatment_group)` subjects, and the control group had `r nrow(control_group)` subjects. Figure (figure #) shows the distribution of the treatment and control group, and figure (figure #) shows the distribution of the `r nrow(treatment_group)` treatment subjects across the three treatment groups.
As evident from this figure, our treatment group has more subjects compared to the control group, and this was intentional and part 
of our survey design. Since we had three sub groups within our treatment, we wanted to ensure that each of the 
subgroups have an adequate number of subjects. 

The sample we collected included `r df_finished%>%filter(Gender=='Female')%>%nrow()` female respondents, `r df_finished%>%filter(Gender=='Male')%>%nrow()` male subjects and `r df_finished%>%filter(Gender=="Non-binary / third gender")%>%nrow()` that identified as Non-binary / third gender

Most of the respondents in our survey had completed a four-year college degree. In addition to that, over 50 individuals had 
completed a Masters Degree or a Ph.D. The age distribution shown in figure (figure#) shows that a most of the subjects were between the age of 25 and 29 followed by those who are 35 or more. 


### Distribution among Treatment Groups and Control Groups

```{r}
group_dist<- ggplot(data = df_finished)+
  aes(x = factor(group),fill = group)+
  geom_bar(stat = "count")+ggtitle("Subject Distribution")+xlab("Group")

  aes(x = factor(subgroup),fill = group)+
  geom_bar(stat = "count")+ggtitle("Subject Distribution By Sub Groups")+xlab("SubGroup")
```

```{r}

          labels = c("A", "B"),
          ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
```



### Demographic Distribution 

#### Gender
```{r}

#### Age Distribution
```{r}
ggplot(data = df_finished)+
  aes(x = factor(df_finished$Age),fill= Age)+

# Testing to see if there is a Association between Gender and being in the control group 
```{r}
# Is the Gender distribution in the treatment and control group the same or different
# Ran a Fisher Test since the  the smallest expected frequency is lower than 5
df <- table(df_finished$Gender, df_finished$group)
fisher.test(df)
# seems like there is an association between gender and being the control or treatment group

```
